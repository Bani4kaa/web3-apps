These are all my web3 apps most of them require api keys to certian things so read carefully or the programs might not work I don't have any type of license and you don't need to mention me in any use of the code :)


Projects:

key_to_address : It uses the generation.py to generate meta mask 12 key words auth then uses the main.py to convert them to real wallets if they exist and check for the balance if they have any balance they will be shown all, because I don't want to make them repeat I have the used.txt and all things in used.txt are not used again, all the 12 word keys are put in mnemonics.txt and you need to clear them each time you run the main.py because you are just going to scan the same keys again and again for faster generation you can use multiple cmd and just launch the python code in more ways. This is not working very good and might or will never make any money so I am putting it as a public source!
